The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical councils (and is hence styled only schismatic, not heretical, by the Roman Catholic Church), has as its creed the Niceno-Constantinopolitan (without the later addition of the filioque, which, with the doctrine it represents, the church decisively rejects), baptizes infants with trine immersion, makes confirmation follow immediately upon baptism, administers the Communion in both kinds (using leavened bread) and to infants as well as adults, permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep their wives afterward, but not to marry a second time, selects its bishops from the monastic clergy only, recognizes the offices of bishop, priest, and deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders, venerates relics and icons, and has an elaborate ritual.</entry> <entry><word>Eau forte</word> (<part></part>) An etching or a print from an etched plate.</entry> <entry><word>Ecarte</word> (<part>n.</part>) A game at cards for two persons, with 32 cards, ranking K, Q, J, A, 10, 9, 8, 7.

It was formerly called assimilation, but this is now commonly used as in animal physiology. The details of the process are not yet clearly known. Baeyer's theory is that the carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide, which, uniting with the hydrogen of the water in the cell, produces formaldehyde, the latter forming various sugars through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are secretion products of the chloroplasts, derived from decomposition of previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly translocated, those that accumulate being changed to starch, which appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and within a certain range of temperature, varying according to climate. This is the only way in which a plant is able to organize carbohydrates.

In a strict sense the term post-impressionism is used to denote the effort at self-expression, rather than representation, shown in the work of Cezanne, Matisse, etc.; but it is more broadly used to include cubism, the theory or practice of a movement in both painting and  sculpture which lays stress upon volume as the important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use of geometrical figures or solids only; and futurism, a theory or practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and to represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the post-impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another, so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They tend to, and sometimes reach, a condition in which both representation and traditional decoration are entirely abolished and a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in an arbitrary and personal language.</entry> <entry><word>Pot</word> (<part>v. t.</part>) To shoot for the pot, i.e., cooking; to secure or hit by a pot shot; to shoot when no special skill is needed.</entry> <entry><word>Pot</word> (<part>v. t.</part>) To secure; gain; win; bag.</entry> <entry><word>Pot</word> (<part>v. i.</part>) To take a pot shot or shots, as at game or an enemy.</entry> <entry><word>Pot</word> (<part>n.</part>) The total of the bets at stake at one time, as in racing or card playing; the pool;</entry> <entry><word>Pot</word> (<part>n.</part>) a horse heavily backed; a favorite.</entry> <entry><word>Pot</word> (<part>n.</part>) A plain defensive headpiece; later, and perhaps in a jocose sense, any helmet; -- called also pot helmet.</entry> <entry><word>Pot</word> (<part>n.</part>) The total of the bets at one time; the pool.</entry> <entry><word>Pot-au-feu</word> (<part>n.</part>) A dish of broth, meat, and vegetables prepared by boiling in a pot, -- a dish esp. common among the French.</entry> <entry><word>Poteen</word> (<part>n.</part>) Alt. of Potheen</entry> <entry><word>Potheen</word> (<part>n.</part>) Whisky distilled in a small way privately or illicitly by the Irish peasantry.</entry> <entry><word>-tiches</word> (<part>pl. </part>) of Potiche</entry> <entry><word>Potiche</word> (<part>n.</part>) A vase with a separate cover, the body usually rounded or polygonal in plan with nearly vertical sides, a neck of smaller size, and a rounded shoulder.</entry> <entry><word>Pot lace</word> (<part></part>) Lace whose pattern includes one or more representations of baskets or bowls from which flowers spring.</entry> <entry><word>Potlatch</word> (<part>n.</part>) Among the Kwakiutl, Chimmesyan, and other Indians of the northwestern coast of North America, a ceremonial distribution by a man of gifts to his own and neighboring tribesmen, often, formerly, to his own impoverishment.

Symbol, Ra; atomic weight, 226.4. Radium was discovered by M. and Mme. Curie, of Paris, who in 1902 separated compounds of it by a tedious process from pitchblende. Its compounds color flames carmine and give a characteristic spectrum. It resembles barium chemically. Radium preparations are remarkable for maintaining themselves at a higher temperature than their surroundings, and for their radiations, which are of three kinds: alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays (see these terms). By reason of these rays they ionize gases, affect photographic plates, cause sores on the skin, and produce many other striking effects. Their degree of activity depends on the proportion of radium present, but not on its state of chemical combination or on external conditions.The radioactivity of radium is therefore an atomic property, and is explained as result from a disintegration of the atom. This breaking up occurs in at least seven stages; the successive main products have been studied and are called radium emanation or exradio, radium A, radium B, radium C, etc. (The emanation is a heavy gas, the later products are solids.) These products are regarded as unstable elements, each with an atomic weight a little lower than its predecessor. It is possible that lead is the stable end product. At the same time the light gas helium is formed; it probably consists of the expelled alpha particles. The heat effect mentioned above is ascribed to the impacts of these particles. Radium, in turn, is believed to be formed indirectly by an immeasurably slow disintegration of uranium.</entry> <entry><word>Raffia palm</word> (<part></part>) A pinnate-leaved palm (Raphia ruffia) native of Madagascar, and of considerable economic importance on account of the strong fiber (raffia) obtained from its leafstalks.</entry> <entry><word>Raffia palm</word> (<part></part>) The jupati palm.</entry> <entry><word>Raffle</word> (<part>v.</part>) Refuse; rubbish; raff.</entry> <entry><word>Rag</word> (<part>v. t.</part>) To play or compose (a piece, melody, etc.) in syncopated time.</entry> <entry><word>Rag</word> (<part>v. t.</part>) To dance to ragtime music, esp. in some manner considered indecorous.</entry> <entry><word>Ragnarok</word> (<part>n.</part>) Alt. of Ragnarok</entry> <entry><word>Ragnarok</word> (<part>n.</part>) The so-called "Twilight of the Gods" (called in German Gotterdammerung), the final destruction of the world in the great conflict between the Aesir (gods) on the one hand, and on the other, the gaints and the powers of Hel under the leadership of Loki (who is escaped from bondage).</entry> <entry><word>Ragtime</word> (<part>n.</part>) Time characterized by syncopation, as in many negro melodies.</entry> <entry><word>Raiffeisen</word> (<part>a.</part>) Designating, or pertaining to, a form of cooperative bank founded among the German agrarian population by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen (1818-88); as, Raiffeisen banks, the Raiffeisen system, etc. The banks are unlimited-liability institutions making small loans at a low rate of interest, for a designated purpose, to worthy members only.</entry> <entry><word>Rail</word> (<part>n.</part>) A railroad as a means of transportation; as, to go by rail; a place not accesible by rail.</entry> <entry><word>Railroad</word> (<part>v. t.</part>) To carry or send by railroad; usually fig., to send or put through at high speed or in great haste; to hurry or rush unduly; as, to railroad a bill through Condress.</entry> <entry><word>Raki</word> (<part>n.</part>) Alt. of Rakee</entry> <entry><word>Rakee</word> (<part>n.</part>) A kind of ardent spirits used in southern Europe and the East, distilled from grape juice, grain, etc.</entry> <entry><word>Rallies</word> (<part>v. t.</part>) A French political group, also known as the Constitutional Right from its position in the Chambers, mainly monarchists who rallied to the support of the Republic in obedience to the encyclical put forth by Pope Leo XIII. in Feb., 1892.</entry> <entry><word>Ramekin</word> (<part>n.</part>) = Ramequin.</entry> <entry><word>Ramequin</word> (<part>n.</part>) The porcelian or earthen mold in which ramequins are baked and served, by extension, any dish so used.</entry> <entry><word>Ramtil</word> (<part>n.</part>) A tropical African asteraceous shrub (Guizotia abyssinica) cultivated for its seeds (called ramtil, / niger, seeds) which yield a valuable oil used for food and as an illuminant.</entry> <entry><word>Rancheria</word> (<part>n.</part>) A dwelling place of a ranchero.</entry> <entry><word>Rancheria</word> (<part>n.</part>) A small settlement or collection of ranchos, or rude huts, esp. for Indians.</entry> <entry><word>Rancheria</word> (<part>n.</part>) Formerly, in the Philippines, a political division of the pagan tribes.</entry> <entry><word>Rand</word> (<part>n.</part>) Rim; egde; border.</entry> <entry><word>Rangy</word> (<part>v. i.</part>) Inclined or able to range, or rove about, for considerable distances; apt or suited for much roving, -- chiefly used of cattle.</entry> <entry><word>Rapid-fire</word> (<part>a.</part>) Alt. of Rapid-firing</entry> <entry><word>Rapid-firing</word> (<part>a.</part>) Firing shots in rapid succession.</entry> <entry><word>Rapid-firing</word> (<part>a.</part>) Capable of being fired rapidly; -- applied to single-barreled guns of greater caliber than small arms, mounted so as to be quickly trained and elevated, with a quick-acting breech mechanism operated by a single motion of a crank or lever (abbr.

In Great Britain the ultimate real reserve is the gold kept on hand in the Bank of England, largely represented by the notes in hand in its own banking department; and any balance which a bank has with the Bank of England is a part of its reserve. In the United States the reserve of a national bank consists of the amount of lawful money it holds on hand against deposits, which is required by law to be not less than 15 per cent (U. S. Rev. Stat. secs. 5191, 5192), three fifths of which the banks not in a reserve city (which see) may keep deposited as balances in national banks that are in reserve cities (U. S. Rev. Stat. sec. 5192).</entry> <entry><word>Reserve</word> (<part>n.</part>) The amount of funds or assets necessary for a company to have at any given time to enable it, with interest and premiums paid as they shall accure, to meet all claims on the insurance then in force as they would mature according to the particular mortality table accepted. The reserve is always reckoned as a liability, and is calculated on net premiums. It is theoretically the difference between the present value of the total insurance and the present value of the future premiums on the insurance. The reserve, being an amount for which another company could, theoretically, afford to take over the insurance, is sometimes called the reinsurance fund or the self-insurance fund. For the first year upon any policy the net premium is called the initial reserve, and the balance left at the end of the year including interest is the terminal reserve. For subsequent years the initial reserve is the net premium, if any, plus the terminal reserve of the previous year. The portion of the reserve to be absorbed from the initial reserve in any year in payment of losses is sometimes called the insurance reserve, and the terminal reserve is then called the investment reserve.</entry> <entry><word>Reserve</word> (<part>n.</part>) In exhibitions, a distinction which indicates that the recipient will get a prize if another should be disqualified.</entry> <entry><word>Reserve</word> (<part>n.</part>) A resist.</entry> <entry><word>Reserve</word> (<part>n.</part>) A preparation used on an object being electroplated to fix the limits of the deposit.</entry> <entry><word>Reserve</word> (<part>n.</part>) See Army organization, above.</entry> <entry><word>Reserve city</word> (<part></part>) In the national banking system of the United States, any of certain cities in which the national banks are required (U.

The banks in certain of the reserve cities (specifically called central reserve cities) are required to keep their reserve on hand in cash; banks in other reserve cities may keep half of their reserve as deposits in these banks (U. S. Rev. Stat. sec. 5195).</entry> <entry><word>Residencia</word> (<part>n.</part>) In Spanish countries, a court or trial held, sometimes as long as six months, by a newly elected official, as the governor of a province, to examine into the conduct of a predecessor.</entry> <entry><word>Resist</word> (<part>n.</part>) Something that resists or prevents a certain action;</entry> <entry><word>Resist</word> (<part>n.</part>) A substance applied to a surface, as of metal, to prevent the action on it of acid or other chemical agent.</entry> <entry><word>Resistance frame</word> (<part></part>) A rheostat consisting of an open frame on which are stretched spirals of wire.

It is said to have consisted originally of ten months, Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, and December, having a total of 304 days. Numa added two months, Januarius at the beginning of the year, and Februarius at the end, making in all 355 days. He also ordered an intercalary month, Mercedinus, to be inserted every second year. Later the order of the months was changed so that January should come before February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose care it was committed, this calendar fell into confusion. It was replaced by the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month, the Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the calends, the nones, and the ides. The calends were always the first day of the month. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), and October, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on the eighth day (the ninth, counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan. 13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides, and Jan. 11, the third day before the ides (since the ides count as one), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February.</entry> <entry><word>Ronin</word> (<part>n.</part>) In Japan, under the feudal system, a samurai who had renounced his clan or who had been discharged or ostracized and had become a wanderer without a lord; an outcast; an outlaw.</entry> <entry><word>Rontgen</word> (<part>a.</part>) Of or pertaining to the German physicist Wilhelm Konrad Rontgen, or the rays discovered by him; as, Rontgen apparatus.</entry> <entry><word>Rontgenize</word> (<part>v. t.</part>) To render (air or other gas) conducting by the passage of Rontgen rays.</entry> <entry><word>Rontgen ray</word> (<part></part>) Any of the rays produced when cathode rays strike upon surface of a solid (as the wall of the vacuum tube).

When it consists of corporations it may be effected by putting a majority of their stock either in the hands of a board of trustees (whence the name trust for the combination) or by transferring a majority to a holding company. The advantages of a trust are partly due to the economies made possible in carrying on a large business, as well as the doing away with competition.

There are practically only two distinct kinds, and they are typified in the de Laval and the Parsons and Curtis turbines. The de Laval turbine is an impulse turbine, in which steam impinges upon revolving blades from a flared nozzle. The flare of the nozzle causes expansion of the steam, and hence changes its pressure energy into kinetic energy. An enormous velocity (30,000 revolutions per minute in the 5 H. P. size) is requisite for high efficiency, and the machine has therefore to be geared down to be of practical use. Some recent development of this type include turbines formed of several de Laval elements compounded as in the ordinary expansion engine. The Parsons turbine is an impulse-and-reaction turbine, usually of the axial type. The steam is constrained to pass successively through alternate rows of fixed and moving blades, being expanded down to a condenser pressure of about 1 lb. per square inch absolute. The Curtis turbine is somewhat simpler than the Parsons, and consists of elements each of which has at least two rows of moving blades and one row of stationary. The bucket velocity is lowered by fractional velocity reduction. Both the Parsons and Curtis turbines are suitable for driving dynamos and steamships directly. In efficiency, lightness, and bulk for a given power, they compare favorably with reciprocating engines.</entry> <entry><word>Turbogenerator</word> (<part>n.</part>) An electric generator or dynamo which is combined on one frame with a turbomotor, by which it is driven.</entry> <entry><word>Turkey-trot</word> (<part>n.</part>) An eccentric ragtime dance, danced with the feet well apart and with a characteristic rise on the ball of the foot, followed by a drop upon the heel.
