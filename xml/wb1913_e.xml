The form e- occurs instead of ex- before b, d, g, l, m, n, r, and v, as in ebullient, emanate, enormous, etc. In words from the French it often appears as es-, sometimes as s- or e-; as, escape, scape, elite.  Ex-, prefixed to names implying office, station, condition, denotes that the person formerly held the office, or is out of the office or condition now; as, ex-president, ex-governor, ex-mayor, ex-convict. The Greek form 'ex becomes ex in English, as in exarch; 'ek becomes ec, as in eccentric.</entry> <entry><word>Exacerrated</word> <part>imp.  /  p. p.</part> of Exacerbate</entry> <entry><word>Exacerrating</word> <part>p. pr.  /  vb. n.</part> of Exacerbate</entry> <entry><word>Exacerbate</word> <part>v. t.</part> To render more violent or bitter;
