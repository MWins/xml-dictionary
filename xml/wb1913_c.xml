<body><entry><word>C</word> <part></part> C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from the Latin letter C, which in old Latin represented the sounds of k, and g (in go); its original value being the latter. In Anglo-Saxon words, or Old English before the Norman Conquest, it always has the sound of k. The Latin C was the same letter as the Greek /, /, and came from the Greek alphabet. The Greeks got it from the Ph/nicians. The English name of C is from the Latin name ce, and was derived, probably, through the French. Etymologically C is related to g, h, k, q, s (and other sibilant sounds). Examples of these relations are in L. acutus, E. acute, ague; E. acrid, eager, vinegar; L. cornu, E. horn; E. cat, kitten; E. coy, quiet; L. circare, OF. cerchier, E. search.</entry> <entry><word>C</word> <part></part> The keynote of the normal or "natural" scale, which has neither flats nor sharps in its signature; also, the third note of the relative minor scale of the same.</entry> <entry><word>C</word> <part></part> C after the clef is the mark of common time, in which each measure is a semibreve (four fourths or crotchets); for alla breve time it is written /.</entry> <entry><word>C</word> <part></part> The "C clef," a modification of the letter C, placed on any line of the staff, shows that line to be middle C.</entry> <entry><word>C</word> <part></part> As a numeral, C stands for Latin centum or 100, CC for 200, etc.</entry> <entry><word>Caaba</word> <part>n.</part> The small and nearly cubical stone building, toward which all Mohammedans must pray.</entry> <entry><word>Caas</word> <part>n. sing.  /  pl.</part> Case.</entry> <entry><word>Cab</word> <part>n.</part> A kind of close carriage with two or four wheels, usually a public vehicle.</entry> <entry><word>Cab</word> <part>n.</part> The covered part of a locomotive, in which the engineer has his station.</entry> <entry><word>Cab</word> <part>n.</part> A Hebrew dry measure, containing a little over two (2.37) pints.</entry> <entry><word>Cabal</word> <part>n.</part> Tradition; occult doctrine.
