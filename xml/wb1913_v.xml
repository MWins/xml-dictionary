<BODY><entry><word>V</word> <part></part> V, the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character, U being the cursive form, while V is better adapted for engraving, as in stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel / (see Y), this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u, w, f, b, p; as in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save; trover, troubadour, trope. See U, F, etc.</entry><entry><word>V</word> <part></part> As a numeral, V stands for five, in English and Latin.</entry><entry><word>Vaagmer</word> <part>n.</part> The dealfish.</entry><entry><word>Vacancies</word> <part>pl. </part> of Vacancy</entry><entry><word>Vacancy</word> <part>n.</part> The quality or state of being vacant; emptiness; hence, freedom from employment; intermission; leisure; idleness; listlessness.</entry><entry><word>Vacancy</word> <part>n.</part> That which is vacant.</entry><entry><word>Vacancy</word> <part>n.</part> Empty space; vacuity; vacuum.</entry><entry><word>Vacancy</word> <part>n.</part> An open or unoccupied space between bodies or things; an interruption of continuity; chasm; gap; as, a vacancy between buildings; a vacancy between sentences or thoughts.</entry><entry><word>Vacancy</word> <part>n.</part> Unemployed time; interval of leisure; time of intermission; vacation.</entry><entry><word>Vacancy</word> <part>n.</part> A place or post unfilled; an unoccupied office; as, a vacancy in the senate, in a school, etc.</entry><entry><word>Vacant</word> <part>a.</part> Deprived of contents; not filled; empty; as, a vacant room.</entry><entry><word>Vacant</word> <part>a.</part> Unengaged with business or care; unemployed; unoccupied; disengaged; free; as, vacant hours.</entry><entry><word>Vacant</word> <part>a.</part> Not filled or occupied by an incumbent, possessor, or officer; as, a vacant throne; a vacant parish.</entry><entry><word>Vacant</word> <part>a.</part> Empty of thought; thoughtless; not occupied with study or reflection; as, a vacant mind.</entry><entry><word>Vacant</word> <part>a.</part> Abandoned; having no heir, possessor, claimant, or occupier; as, a vacant estate.</entry><entry><word>Vacantly</word> <part>adv.</part> In a vacant manner; inanely.</entry><entry><word>Vacated</word> <part>imp. / p. p.</part> of Vacate</entry><entry><word>Vacating</word> <part>p. pr. / vb. n.</part> of Vacate</entry><entry><word>Vacate</word> <part>v. t.</part> To make vacant; to leave empty; to cease from filling or occupying; as, it was resolved by Parliament that James had vacated the throne of England; the tenant vacated the house.</entry><entry><word>Vacate</word> <part>v. t.</part> To annul; to make void; to deprive of force; to make of no authority or validity; as, to vacate a commission or a charter; to vacate proceedings in a cause.</entry><entry><word>Vacate</word> <part>v. t.</part> To defeat; to put an end to.</entry><entry><word>Vacation</word> <part>n.</part> The act of vacating; a making void or of no force; as, the vacation of an office or a charter.</entry><entry><word>Vacation</word> <part>n.</part> Intermission of a stated employment, procedure, or office; a period of intermission; rest; leisure.</entry><entry><word>Vacation</word> <part>n.</part> Intermission of judicial proceedings; the space of time between the end of one term and the beginning of the next; nonterm; recess.</entry><entry><word>Vacation</word> <part>n.</part> The intermission of the regular studies and exercises of an educational institution between terms; holidays; as, the spring vacation.</entry><entry><word>Vacation</word> <part>n.</part> The time when an office is vacant; esp.
